 A lightweight library to make PyTorch training memory visible in real time (in CLI and Notebook).

## The Problem

Training large machine learning models often feels like a black box. One minute everything's running and the next, you're staring at a cryptic **"CUDA out of memory"** error.

Pinpointing which part of the model is consuming too much memory or slowing things down is frustrating and time-consuming. Traditional profiling tools can be overly complex or lack the granularity deep learning developers need.

## üí° Why TraceML?

`traceml` is designed to give you real-time, granular insights into memory usage without heavy overhead. It works both in the **terminal (CLI) and inside Jupyter notebooks**, so you can pick the workflow that fits you best:

‚úÖ System + process-level usage (CPU, RAM, GPU)

‚úÖ PyTorch layer-level memory allocation (via decorator/instance tracing)

‚úÖ Live activation & gradient memory

No config, no setup, just plug-and-trace.


## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

For developer mode:
```bash
pip install '.[dev]'
```


## üöÄ Usage

### Registering your model for tracing

To capture **memory usage**, you first need to register your model with TraceML. There are two simple ways:

#### 1. With a class decorator (recommended)

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from traceml.decorator import trace_model

@trace_model()
class TinyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(100, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)
```

‚úÖ Any instance of `TinyNet` will now be automatically traced.

#### 2. With an explicit model instance

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from traceml.decorator import trace_model_instance

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(100, 50),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(50, 10)
).to("cuda")

# Attach hooks so TraceML can see memory events
trace_model_instance(model)
```

‚úÖ Best when you build models dynamically or don't want to decorate the class.



Then, choose whichever fits your workflow.

### üìì Notebook

Run TraceML directly in Jupyter/Colab:

```shell
from traceml.decorator import trace_model_instance
from traceml.manager.tracker_manager import TrackerManager

# Attach TraceML hooks
trace_model_instance(model)

# Start live tracker
tracker = TrackerManager(interval_sec=1.0, mode="notebook")
tracker.start()

# üîÑ Train as usual
train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, optimizer, scheduler, scaler, device, dtype)

# Stop and show summaries
tracker.stop()
tracker.log_summaries()

```

### Terminal/CLI

Wrap your training script to see live dashboards in your terminal:
```bash
traceml run <your_training_script.py>
```


## Examples

```bash
# Trace an explicitly defined model instance
traceml run src/examples/tracing_with_model_instance

# Trace a model using a class decorator (recommended)
traceml run src/examples/tracing_with_class_decorator
```

### üìì Notebook Example

You can also run TraceML inside Jupyter/Colab.
See the full [example notebook](src/examples/tracing_bert_notebook.ipynb) for a working demo.

 Notebook output will refresh live per interval, similar to the terminal dashboard.


## üîé How the Samplers Work

TraceML introduces samplers that collect memory usage at intervals, not layer-by-layer traces only:

- SystemSampler ‚Üí CPU, RAM, GPU usage sampled at a fixed frequency.

- LayerMemorySampler ‚Üí Parameter allocation (per module, not per parameter).

- ActivationMemorySampler ‚Üí Tracks per-layer forward activations. Maintains current and global peak values, and estimates total activation memory for a forward pass.

- GradientMemorySampler ‚Üí Tracks per-layer backward gradients. Maintains current and global peak values, and estimates total gradient memory during backpropagation.

This means what you see in your terminal is a rolling snapshot of memory over time, giving you:

- Live per-layer breakdowns

- Current vs global peaks

- Running totals of activation + gradient memory

This design makes TraceML lightweight compared to full profilers ‚Äî you get practical insights without slowing training to a crawl.

## üìä Current Features

- Live CPU, RAM, and GPU usage (System + Current Process)
- PyTorch module-level memory tracking
- Live activation memory tracking (per layer, plus totals)
- Live gradient memory tracking (per layer, plus totals)
- Real-time terminal dashboards via Rich
- Notebook support

## Coming Soon

- Step & operation timers (forward, backward, optimizer)
- Export logs as JSON / CSV
- More visual dashboards
